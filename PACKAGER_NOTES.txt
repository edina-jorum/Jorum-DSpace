Jorum-DSpace Packager Notes 
===========================

One of the major modification made to DSpace was the support for common learning content
package standards e.g. IMS and SCORM. 

If a user submits a recognised content package, DSpace will automatically read the metadata
from the package manifest file and pre-populate this in the web interface during a submission.

For DSpace to recognise a submission as a content package, the submission must meet the criteria 
included below:

1. The submission is a Zip archive

2. The submission contains a file titled "imsmanifest.xml" in the root of the Zip archive

3. The "imsmanifest.xml" file must be a valid and well formed XML document

4. The manifest uses supported namespaces (see later)

5. Only one metadata standard will be supported in the manifest i.e. either IMSMD, LOM or DC - not a combination.

Licence Information
===================

Licence information can be read from the package manifest if it is expressed in the appropriate metadata 
element. The code will use the following XPath expressions to isolate the licence information:

IMSMD: //rights/description/langstring
LOM: //rights/description/string
DC: //rights
QDC: //rights[@xsi:type="dcterms:URI"]

NOTE: If an unsupported or no licence is found, the depositor will be prompted to select a new licence
for the item as part of the submission process.

Supported Content Package Namespaces
====================================

The following namespaces are supported in content package manifest files:

IMS: http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imscp_v1p1
SCORM: http://www.adlnet.org/xsd/adlcp_rootv1p2
SCORM: http://www.adlnet.org/xsd/adlcp_v1p3

Supported Metadata Namespaces
====================================

The following namespaces are supported for metadata in content package manifest files:

IMSMD: http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imsmd_v1p2
LOM: http://ltsc.ieee.org/xsd/LOM
DC: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
QDC: http://purl.org/dc/terms/

Package Previews
================

When a user submits a recognised and supported content package, a package preview will also be
created. This package preview is stored as an HTML file within a "PREVIEW_CP" bundle. This single
HTML file provides a series of HTML links for the package organisation and a main area for viewing 
package content.

As the preview is actually a HTML file which shows both the DSpace header and footer, branding etc,
all the package previews should be re-generated if any modifications are made to the visual appearance
of DSpace e.g. the theme, headers, footers etc.

In order to regenerate all the package previews, the following command must be executed on the 
DSpace server:

<dspace installation dir>/bin/dsrun uk.ac.jorum.dspace.utils.GeneratePreviews <admin email>

e.g.

/opt/jorum_dspace/bin/dsrun uk.ac.jorum.dspace.utils.GeneratePreviews root@localhost 

*NOTE*
If you have a lot of items in DSpace, you may need to allocate a large heap size to the above command.
The code is single threaded and can take some time to complete (and use a lot of memory). 
Previews will only be altered if the command successfully completes.

e.g. to allocate a 2 Gb heap use: 

JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx2048m /opt/jorum_dspace/bin/dsrun uk.ac.jorum.dspace.utils.GeneratePreviews root@localhost
